The first Edinburgh Autistic Pride Picnic will be happening on Sunday the 17th of June, in the Meadows, on the grass near the Prince Albert sundial - the big stone monument near the trees at the west side of the Meadows.

If the weather is wet, there's some shelter at the nearby Pavilion Cafe; if it gets really dire, there are other nice places we could decamp to nearby.

Bring picnic foods and drinks, stimtoys and such (we will also bring some things). Feel free to invite all your autistic friends, and bring along non-autistic friends as well. We're expecting it to be a pretty low-key event.

At least one small, friendly dog will be in attendance.

Note that the guest list is hidden, but that doesn't necessarily stop Facebook from telling anyone you're coming, so if you're not out as autistic to your Facebook friends, you might prefer to just save the event rather than saying you're attending.

Official Autistic Pride Day is the 18th of June every year. Note that this is not specifically Autistic LGBT Pride, just Autistic Pride, though if you are also proud of your sexuality and gender, that's definitely 100% fine.
