The [Autistic Mutual Aid Society Edinburgh (AMASE)](/) ran a series of workshops with the title 'Introduction to Neurodiversity: Understanding autism from an autistic point of view' as part of the [Festival of Creative Learning](http://www.festivalofcreativelearning.ed.ac.uk/). These were hugely oversubscribed, and extremely well-received, with 77% of participants rating them 'very informative', 81% 'very enjoyable' and 83% saying they woud be very likely to recommend them to a friend or colleague. Here are some of the comments we received:

> Getting the perspective of autistic people rather than professionals who work with autistic people was refreshing. It was very well presented, helped to build empathy, and very informative. 10/10 would come again! 

> This course was highly recommended by two colleagues and I can only agree. Everyone should take part, it gives a better understanding of anxiety as well. 

> This was a fascinating and illuminating workshop, and, even as someone who has spoken to autistic friends about their experiences before, I still learnt a lot. I think there is a real need for more of this around the university (and in general!), if there is any way to keep running these, or to perhaps record one to be available to those who couldn't attend. 

We hope to run more of these workshops in the future. Please email workshop@amase.org.uk with any enquiries.

The following is the original blurb for the workshops.

This is an autism awareness workshop with a difference. Designed and delivered by autistic people, it provides an opportunity to hear from those with first-hand experience.

In this immersive session, participants will be able to explore the concept of neurodiversity (the idea that different cognitive styles are part of natural human variation) in an environment engineered to autistic preferences, and will take part in exercises to help them develop an understanding of what it's like to be autistic.

The workshop is free to attend and will run several times during the week in order to keep group sizes small.
