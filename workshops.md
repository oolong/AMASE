The [Autistic Mutual Aid Society Edinburgh (AMASE)](/) will be running a workshop with the title 'Introduction to Neurodiversity: Understanding autism from an autistic point of view' as part of the [Festival of Creative Learning](http://www.festivalofcreativelearning.ed.ac.uk/). This is an autism awareness workshop with a difference. Designed and delivered by autistic people, it provides an opportunity to hear from those with first-hand experience.

In this immersive session, participants will be able to explore the concept of neurodiversity (the idea that different cognitive styles are part of natural human variation) in an environment engineered to autistic preferences, and will take part in exercises to help them develop an understanding of what it's like to be autistic.

The workshop is free to attend and will run several times during the week in order to keep group sizes small. 
*    19th February, 14:00-15:30
*    20th February,  10:30-12:00
*    21st February, 10:30-12:00
*    23rd February, 14:00-15:30

It is already at capacity, but you can [put yourself on the waiting list here](http://www.festivalofcreativelearning.ed.ac.uk/search_all_fcl/autism) if you are a staff or student at the University of Edinburgh.
