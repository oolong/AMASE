### Helping autistic people to help each other

We are an autistic-led group based in Edinburgh. All members are on the autistic spectrum, and our goal is to help autistic people to help make each other's lives better through peer support, advocacy and education.

* Read our [open letter](/openletter.html) responding to the way the Scottish Government's recent consultation on the Scottish Strategy for Autism has been conducted.
* We are running [a series of workshops](/workshops.html) as part of the [Festival of Creative Learning](http://www.festivalofcreativelearning.ed.ac.uk/) at Edinburgh University in February.
* We run an Autistic-Led Late-Identification Group for people who have realised in adult life that they are on the autistic spectrum, with support from [Number 6](http://www.number6.org.uk/).
